Hello, I've created this blog is to show people such as my friends, colleagues or future employees what projects I've worked on and what my thought process was.

My interest in programming has emerged during highschool from games, starting with games that allowed scripting and later creating total conversion mods for the game Minecraft.

### More Information

I have finished classes for:
C, C++, Java, Databases, Computer Graphics, A.I., Data Networks, Calculus, Digital Signal Processing (intoductionary), Microcontrollers, Embedded Systems (including VHDL), Telecom & Wireless, Electric Circuits DC/AC. 

I have gained experience from my personal projects and experiments in Unity3D, Evolutionary Machine Learning, Linux and Game Engine Design.

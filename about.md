Hello, the reason I created this blog is to show people such as my friends, colleges or future employees what projects I've worked on and how my thought proces was.

My interest in programming has emerged during highschool from games, starting with games that allowed scripting and later creating total conversion mods for the game Minecraft.

### More Information

I have finished classes for: C, C++, Java, Databases, Computer Graphics, A.I., Data Networks, Calculus, Digital Signal Processing (intoductionary), Microcontrollers, Embedded Systems (included VHDL), Telecom & Wireless, Electric Circuits DC/AC. I have gained experience from my personal projects and experiments in Unity3D, Evolutinonary Machine Learning, Linux and Game Engine Design.
